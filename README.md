# SQL Injection Techniques Showcase

Welcome to the SQL Injection Techniques Showcase repository. This project demonstrates various angles of SQL Injection attacks, highlighting their techniques and potential impacts.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

-   Educate on different methods used in SQL Injection attacks.
-   Provide practical examples of SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
-   Demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can be exploited.

## Why Python?

Python was chosen as the underlying programming language for this project due to its:

-   **Simplicity:** Python's straightforward syntax makes it easy to write and understand code, facilitating learning and demonstration.
-   **Rich Libraries Support:** Python offers a vast array of libraries and frameworks that support various functionalities required for the project.
-   **Speed of Execution:** Python, while not the fastest language, is efficient enough for scripting and executing the required tests in this context.

## Contents

This repository contains 14 different tests, each demonstrating a unique SQL Injection technique. The tests cover a wide range of scenarios and methods to exploit SQL vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

To run the tests, you will need to have Python installed on your system. Follow the instructions below to get started:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sql-injection-techniques.git
    cd sql-injection-techniques
    ```

2. Run the tests:
    ```bash
    python test_script.py <target_url>
    ```

Replace `<target_url>` with the URL of the target application you want to test.
